# The Course Catalog API

## TODO
- [ ] Copy over GraphQL API
- [ ] Copy over its dependency graph
- [ ] Copy over Data Pipeline
- [ ] Copy over its dependency graph
- [ ] Clean up config & make sure things run locally
- [ ] Copy over infrastructure/deployment stuff
- [ ] Associate the new repo with a new project in Terraform Cloud

## Questions
1. Should we rename `class` to `course` in the GraphQL API?
2. What do we do about directory structure?
3. How are we going to share types and modules?
    - Create a Sandbox-sponsored NPM package
4. What do about the `data/` directory (for majors)?

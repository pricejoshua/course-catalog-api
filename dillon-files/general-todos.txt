1. Deployment shenanigans
	- Ideally node_modules wouldn't be copied to dist. Currently they are copied but only sorta - if you remove '--ignore' it errors
	- Currently dist is removed before build and dist/.git is removed after
		- Ideally we aren't building from the root directory, but from src, that way we can only copy src files to dist
2. ES insertion broken
	- elasticProfSerializer.js only picks "name" "emails" "phone" - why?
		- should also pick "id"
	- profSerializer._serializeProf() throws error, why does it 
	- Frontend commit regarding serializers: https://github.com/sandboxnu/searchneu/blob/07486024ec1d8fca38221405548097d0154a0598/backend/database/serializers/profSerializer.js
3. Run CCA Docker Container locally
  - Check 'local-docker.txt' for more specific notes
	- Have separate package.json script to connect to Docker IPs vs localhost
	- Only run Docker IP script from dockerfile
  - Ideally we encapsulate it all in docker-compose.yml, same as Postgres + ES get setup
4. Scraping GUI:
	- At beginning print term, whether custom or not, if custom print filters
	- Separate sections for each phase, with progress bars
	- Pipe current output to log file, put log file link at end of scrape whether it succeeds or fails
	- Name log file by timestamp
	- On error print short error message
	- Clean up scraper output
5. Misc
	- Add author field to Trello for reference (is this Resident Expert?)
	- Uptime Monitor
	- Cleanup old PRs + branches
    - Maybe someone is accidentally pushing old branches? I feel like we deleted branches that have then come back, not sure :ghost:
	- PR feedback - how to ensure no double-work? Trello card? Slack thread?
	- sudo pkill -u postgres - fixes "port 5432 in use" error
	- Course Number filter doesn't work sometimes (maybe just hundreds?)
		- e.g. "ESLG" with max of 500 returns
	- Megan's 2 year scrape kills ES image
	- If you search, scroll down, and then do a second search that keeps the same first search result, then the second search won't scroll back to the top
		- e.g. Spring 2021 -> "Rachlin" -> scroll down -> "CS 1800"
	- Frontend README docs link broken
	- Trello "in prod" not technically true anymore, do we need "to release" col?
	- Change npx to yarn
	- Prune dependencies that should be devDependencies
	- Jake Chvatal's <br> frontend bug
	- "clientVersion" error happens when Postgres URL is incorrect
	- SearchNEU Spring 2020 prod has nothing (last occurrence of PHYS 5126)
	- Tests failing (regtest, etc.)
	- Scraper log: "Parsed undefined in ..."
	- Scroll way back in searchneu history to find GitHub script to redeploy staging images on push to master
	- 2-year-scrape showed 8000 open requests, might just be forgetting to adjust count
	- script the yarn dev:docker && sleep 10 && yarn db:migrate ... etc
    - Implemented in package.json
	- Add docs for /infrastructure scripts, e.g. "Run ./infrastructure/aws/push-image to push a staging image"
		- Had to create access key pair on aws console and 'aws configure' to login
  - Move yarn install into Dockerfile as opposed to in entrypoint.sh
